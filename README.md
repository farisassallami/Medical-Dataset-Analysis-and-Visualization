# Medical-Dataset-Analysis-and-Visualization

## Business Problem
### Overview
In this project, we aim to analyze and visualize three key features in the Medical Dataset: Vitamin D levels, Doctor visits, and Total $ Charge. By exploring these features, we can gain valuable insights that can be leveraged to address various business challenges and opportunities within the healthcare industry.

### Dataset Description
The Medical Dataset consists of anonymized patient records, including information on Vitamin D levels, Doctor visits, and associated charges. The dataset spans a specific time period and encompasses a diverse range of patients with varying medical conditions and demographics.

## Features to Analyze
The following are the features that I will analyze and visualize in the Medical Dataset:
- Vitamin D levels
- Doctor visits
- Total $ Charge

## Vitamin D Levels

1. Is it Discrete or Continuous?
continuous, because there is no gap in the bar plot

2. Does it have a skew? If so, which direction (+/-)
no skew, the data seems to be normally distributed

3. What type of kurtosis does it display? (Mesokurtic, Leptokurtic, Platykurtic)
the kurtosis displayed is mesokurtic since it is normally distributed


## Conclusion
This assignment will help you gain an understanding of how to analyze and visualize data using histograms and kernel density estimates. You will also learn how to identify whether a feature is discrete or continuous, whether it has a skew, and what type of kurtosis it displays.
