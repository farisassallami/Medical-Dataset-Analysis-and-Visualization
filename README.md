# Medical-Dataset-Analysis-and-Visualization

## Introduction
I will be analyzing and visualizing three features in the Medical Dataset. The features to analyze are Vitamin D levels, Doctor visits, and Total $ Charge.

## Features to Analyze
The following are the features that I will analyze and visualize in the Medical Dataset:
- Vitamin D levels
- Doctor visits
- Total $ Charge

  ## Vitamin D Levels

## Visualization Requirements
For each feature, I will perform the following visualizations:
- Plot a histogram with a kde (kernel density estimate)
- Add a line for the mean (red)
- Add a line for the median (green)
- Add a line for for +1 std from the mean (black)
- Add a line for the - 1 std from the mean (black)
- Highlight the range between +1 and =1 std (yellow)

## Analysis Questions
After visualizing each feature, I will answer the following questions:
- Is it Discrete or Continuous?
- Does it have a skew? If so, which direction (+/-)
- What type of kurtosis does it display? (Mesokurtic, Leptokurtic, Platykurtic)

## Conclusion
This assignment will help you gain an understanding of how to analyze and visualize data using histograms and kernel density estimates. You will also learn how to identify whether a feature is discrete or continuous, whether it has a skew, and what type of kurtosis it displays.
